# Loan Default Prediction

A full-cycle machine learning project that focuses on **predicting loan defaults** based on customer and loan attributes.  
The project includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **model building** using various classification algorithms, **evaluation**, and **comparative analysis** to select the best predictive model.

## üìñ About the Project

Loan default prediction is critical for banks and financial institutions to minimize risks and make informed lending decisions.  
This project tackles the real-world problem by:

- Analyzing and preprocessing raw loan data.
- Exploring feature relationships through visual and statistical methods.
- Building several classification models including **Naive Bayes**, **Decision Trees**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
- Evaluating models based on accuracy, confusion matrices, and other performance metrics.
- Selecting the most effective model for predicting whether a loan will default.

By following a full machine learning pipeline, this project demonstrates practical applications of data science and machine learning in the financial sector.
